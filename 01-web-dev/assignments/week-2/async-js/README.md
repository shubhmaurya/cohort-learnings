### Development Setup

1. **Local Setup**:
   - If you have Node.js installed on your computer, you can run these commands locally to verify your solutions.
   - All tests should pass successfully, indicating that your code meets the assignment requirements.

2. **Online Setup**:
   - If you don't have Node.js installed, you can copy the assignments to an online coding environment like repl.it.
   - Note that automated tests might not be available online, so you may need to manually verify your code outputs.
